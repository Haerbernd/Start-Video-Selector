# Video Start Selector
This Program allows you to start a video that was previously assigned an id and also print Tags that were edited to it.

## Setup
The Setup is, especially compared to the former version, very easy.
All you have to do is to start the `Installer.exe` on Windows or python execute the `Installer.py` on Linux (python3 Installer.py).
At the end of the Setup however, you will have to install vlc if you don't have it (will be done automatically) and you will have to enter the path to the `vlc.exe` on Windows.

What you should do after the installation is to edit the _db.json_.
In this file all the Videos, their paths and their tags are stored.
You will have to give each video an id (in the preinstalled db.json it's aaa001), a title (name), enter its path and give it tags.
Be careful: the tags have to be given as strings (they have to be surrunded by quotation marks) and have to be separated by commas.
